h1. Apple Push Notification Server Toolkit

* http://github.com/bpoweski/apnserver

h2. Description

apnserver is a server and set of command line programs to send push notifications to the iPhone.
Apple recomends to maintain an open connection to the push notification service and refrain from 
opening up and tearing down SSL connections reapeated.  To solve this problem an intermediate 
network server is introduced that queues are requests to the APN service and sends them via a 
persistent connection.

h2. APN Server Client

With the APN server client script you can send push notifications directly to 
Apple's APN server over an SSL connection or to the above daemon using a plain socket.
To send a notification to Apple's APN server using SSL the *--pem* option must be used.
